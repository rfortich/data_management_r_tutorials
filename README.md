# Test your data management skills in R by solving practical challenges interactively
These data management tutorials in R were developed with the [learnr package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) by Roberto Fortich Mesa.  

Learnr tutorials usually are very troblesome to share online (they require server space or purchasing of some shiny apps hosting service).  I make use of the workaround developed by git user [syoh](https://github.com/syoh) at this [github repo](https://github.com/syoh/learnr-tutorial) of his.

The trick that facilitates learnr repos in github is to run a Binder service on the top of it. 

Here is a learnr exercise for reading data into RStudio:
